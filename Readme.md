This will be our project (the readme on the example repository has more). ALL Assignments should be a GITHUB repostitory:

Iteration 1: Create a Maven project with OpenCSV working & read & print the contents of a file (an action called parsing).
ParseCSV
In the first 3 iterations we will read a CSV file into a Database & then write out a CSV from the results of a select query.

JSON
The other main data flow for local files, we will be reading a JSON into a database and then writing one out based on a SQL query.

HTML/XML
Extra credit if you want to try using JSoup.
